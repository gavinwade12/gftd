## Motivation

Almost everyday I found myself tumbling down the rabbit hole of distraction on the internet.
Sometimes writing things down provides me with clarity and help me efficiently navigate through
the daily clutter. This phenomenon can be explained by a behavioral psychology theory
of "Commitment and Consistency" which can be summarized as:

> Once a stand is taken, there is a natural tendency to behave in ways that are
stubbornly consistent with the stand.
                                - Robert B. Cialdini, Influence


Write down what you _want_ to do, what you _have_ to get done.  
Let the "Commitment and Consistency" bias take over.
